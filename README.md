# Chef Examples

This repository has cookbooks that provide examples of cookbook patterns for Chef development. It assumes only that you have [ChefDK](https://downloads.getchef.com/chef-dk/mac/#/) installed and working. To use:

* git clone this repository
* change directory (cd) to the example of interest
* read the README to understand the problem and the solution
* run `rake`, which will install the gems locally, with bundler, and run the relevant tests
* now you know you have a working example, copy it and use it FTW!

## But I disagree with you approach to solving the problem!

Then open an issue, and we'll discuss.

## I don't understand your approach

Please open an issue, I'll try to explain better.
