QUESTION: How can I assemble a template from multiple partial templates?

EXAMPLE: This cookbook demonstrates building a template that:
1. always includes local1.conf, with variable content inside that
1. includes the <app>.erb templates when those apps are in the list `my_apps`

DISCUSSION: Still needs the more complex example [described in the Chef template render docs](https://docs.getchef.com/resource_template.html#render-method)
